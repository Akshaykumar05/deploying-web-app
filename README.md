# deploying-web-app
## Task
In this project the task is to deploying a web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application consists of a frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend built with Node.js. Our goal is to set up the necessary AWS services to host and deploy the application securely. Provide a step-by-step plan outlining the AWS services and configurations you would implement to achieve this. Note: Please provide a detailed response explaining each step and the rationale behind your choices. 

* Deploying a web application on AWS involves a combination of services to ensure security, scalability, and efficient deployment. Here's a step-by-step plan to set up the necessary AWS services to host and deploy the application securely:

## Steps
1. Step 1: Plan and Design
* Before you start setting up AWS services, it's important to plan and design your architecture. Consider factors such as application scalability, availability, and security. In this plan, I'll assume a basic setup, but you can expand on it based on your specific requirements.

2. Step 2: Create an AWS Account
* If you don't have an AWS account, sign up for one.

3. Step 3: Set Up Amazon S3 for Frontend Hosting
* Amazon S3 is a cost-effective storage service that is ideal for hosting static web content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

  * Create an S3 bucket for your frontend content.
  * Configure the bucket to enable static website hosting.
  * Upload your frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the S3 bucket.
  * Optionally, enable Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network) to distribute content globally and improve performance.
 
4. Step 4: Set Up a Node.js Server for Backend
* Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) allows you to run virtual servers in the cloud. We'll use this service to host the Node.js backend.

  * Launch an EC2 instance using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that suits your needs (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, etc.).
  * Configure security groups to allow incoming traffic on the necessary ports (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).
  * SSH into the instance and install Node.js and any necessary dependencies.
  * Deploy your Node.js backend code to the instance, either by copying the files or using version control systems like Git.
 
5. Step 5: Set Up Amazon RDS for Database (Optional)
* Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) provides scalable and managed database solutions. If your application requires a database, consider using Amazon RDS.

  * Create an RDS instance with the desired database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  * Configure security groups to allow the EC2 instance to access the RDS instance.
  * Update your Node.js backend to use the RDS instance as the database.
    
6. Step 6: Configure Domain Name
* If you have a custom domain, you can configure it to point to your application's resources.

  * Use Amazon Route 53 to manage your domain's DNS records.
  * Set up appropriate DNS records to point your domain to your frontend (S3/CloudFront) and backend (EC2) resources.
 
 7. Step 7: Secure Your Application
* Security is crucial. Implement these measures:

  * Set up HTTPS using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for both frontend (if using CloudFront) and backend.
  * Configure security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to necessary ports.
  * Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and policies to control access to resources.
  * Implement security best practices in your Node.js application code.
8. Step 8: Continuous Deployment
* Automate the deployment process to ensure efficiency:

  * Use AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
  * Connect your source code repository (e.g., GitHub) to trigger automatic deployments when you push changes.
  * Configure CodeBuild to build and package your frontend and backend code.
  * Deploy the built code to S3 and the EC2 instance as needed.
 
9. Step 9: Monitoring and Scaling
* Implement monitoring and scalability solutions:

  * Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor resources and set up alarms for critical metrics.
  * Implement Auto Scaling for your EC2 instances to handle increased traffic.
  * Consider using AWS Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
  
10. Step 10: Backups and Disaster Recovery
* Ensure data integrity and disaster recovery:

  * Implement automated backups for your RDS database if applicable.
  * Create snapshots of your EC2 instance to enable easy recovery.
